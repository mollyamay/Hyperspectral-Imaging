# Hyperspectral-Imaging

This set of programs is designed to help the user analyze a set of spectra taken during a spatio-spectral (hyperspectral) confocal imaging scan. A few simple programs allow the user to plot all spectra or a reasonable subset to get an idea of what they're going to be fitting. Then, voigt_fit.m allows you to fit one or a few spectra to check the fit parameters and constraints. Finally, the processRamanFixAliasing.m code fits each spectrum to a user-defined number of peaks and outputs images of the desired fit parameters at each point.
